### Day 1: April 6, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Created some basic React components for an NPM module: patch-cords

**Thoughts** I tried 100-days-of-code a while back, and had to end it because I got my first job in tech and didn't have the emotional emergy to code outside of work. Today it has been 77 days since the first COVID-19 case in the United States. Since we are under shelter-in-place anyway, I'm trying this again.
